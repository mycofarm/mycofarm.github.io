We are building a community regeneration hub and spoke system that addresses housing and homelessness, food security, climate recovery goals, public health and wellness, and economic opportunity to sustain a resilient community.

Mycofarm is a community-based approach to addressing homelessness, climate change, food security, economic equity, and waste regeneration. This project will follow the practice of “working open” to use the power, knowledge, and skills of a diverse community of contributors to accomplish something that a single person or a small team couldn’t do alone.
