## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the mycofarm project repository. This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 

## What are we doing?
The time to address the issues our community faces one-at-a-time is over. Interconnected problems require interconnected solutions. Systems theory tells us that a single intervention designed to address a specific problem is not likely to produce satisfactory results in the long term. We recognize the importance of social networks and community participation in large scope and large scale problem solving and the power of our collective imagination to sustain a cohesive solution.
### The problem

-   **Our community needs shelter.** 2,165 people were reported as homeless according to the Lane County 2019 Unsheltered Point in Time Count, 75% of the total were experiencing unsheltered homelessness. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that  “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being, nd the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."
-   **Our community needs food security.** Some 527,000 Oregonians are food insecure, including more than 173,000 children and Lane County's food insecurity rates are among the highest in the state. Food security is “condition in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance, social justice, and democratic decision-making." 
-   **Our community needs to transition to a clean energy economy from fossil fuels and harmful land use practices.** The climate crisis is one of the greatest challenges facing our country and opportunity to build a more just and equitable future.
