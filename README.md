## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the mycofarm project repository.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 

## What are we doing?
The time to address the issues our community faces one-at-a-time is over. Interconnected problems require interconnected solutions. 
### The problem

-   **We need more shelter and housing opportunities in Eugene.** 2,165 people were reported as homeless according to the Lane County 2019 Unsheltered Point in Time Count, 75% of the total were experiencing unsheltered homelessness. 
-   **We need to move off fossil fuels and harmful land use practices and transition to a clean energy economy.** The climate crisis is not only the single greatest challenge facing our country; it is also our single greatest opportunity to build a more just and equitable future.
